Set up a folder structure like this:
Main folder
	-output
	-shapefiles
		-C2002 (these are all folders)
		-C2012
		-L1994
		-L2012
		-S1994
		-S2012

(obviously the folders that represent the dummy data will be different with next week's data)

The shapefiles should each be in their appropriate folder. The output folder will be empty right now. 

Put the script file in the main folder. 

Open RStudio. 

Go to the file menu and choose "Create Project." Tell it to use an "existing directory" and then navigate to the main folder you created in previous step. It will create a .Rproj file in that directory. 

Then open the precinct_calculations.Rmd script I gave you. 

Today you can just run all the code and it will put the new shapefiles in the output directory. 

On Tuesday:
1) create the appropriate new folders for the newshapefiles
2) starting on line 30 of the code, change the path and file names to match the new files
3) If they used different field names in the new files, there may be a small edit or two needed at the end of the script (see my notes at the top of the script)
